# Project Title

## Introduction

This project is designed to [briefly describe the purpose of your project, e.g., "implement a simple shell program for educational purposes"]. It consists of three main files:

- `main.c`
- `shell.c`
- `shell.h`

## Table of Contents

1. [Introduction](#introduction)
2. [Project Structure](#project-structure)
3. [Installation](#installation)
4. [Usage](#usage)
5. [Contributing](#contributing)

## Project Structure

- **main.c**: The entry point of the program. This file initializes the shell environment and starts the main loop.
- **shell.c**: Contains the core functionality of the shell, including command parsing and execution.
- **shell.h**: Header file for `shell.c`, containing function prototypes and necessary includes.

## Installation

To compile and run this project, you need to have a C compiler installed on your system (e.g., `gcc`).

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2. Compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc main.c shell.c -o shell
    ```

## Usage

To run the shell program, execute the compiled binary:
```sh
./shell
```

Once the shell is running, you can enter commands just like you would in a standard terminal.
